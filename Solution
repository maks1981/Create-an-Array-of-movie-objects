//              movieDataBase exercise

// Create an array of movie objects. 
// Each movie should have a title, rating, and hasWatched properties. 
// Iterate through the array and print out something like below example:
// You have watched "Missian Impossible" - 5 stars
// You have not seen "Avengers" - 4.5 stars
// You have not seen "Anaconda" - 3.5 stars
